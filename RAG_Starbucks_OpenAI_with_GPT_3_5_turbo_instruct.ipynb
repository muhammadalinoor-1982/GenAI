Once picked, there are three primary ways to create decaffeinated coffee: the Direct Contact Method, the SWISS WATER® Process and the Natural Decaffeination Process. In each of these methods, the green coffee beans are soaked in warm water, making the caffeine more easily removeable while preserving the flavor within the bean. From there, the caffeine is extracted or dissolves before the beans are roasted to bring out the aroma, acidity, body and flavor.

The best place for storage is ideally in an opaque, airtight container at room temperature and, if possible, away from sunlight and heat. Learn more about how to keep  your coffee fresh . \\u200b\\n\\nHOW IS COFFEE DECAFFEINATED?\\nThe decaffeination process begins with green coffee beans after they are harvested. Once picked, there are three primary ways to create decaffeinated coffee: the Direct Contact Method, the SWISS WATER® Process and the Natural Decaffeination Process. In each of these methods, the green coffee beans are soaked in warm water, making the caffeine more easily removeable while preserving the flavor within the bean. From there, the caffeine is extracted or dissolves before the beans are roasted to bring out the aroma, acidity, body and flavor.
